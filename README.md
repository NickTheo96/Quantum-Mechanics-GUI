# Quantum Mechanics GUI
## Outline of Project ##
This repository contains my first python project (a 3 Week Project completed in 2015 during my second year of undergraduate studies) displaying the properties of an infinite square well barrier and a quantum harmonic oscillator. The purpose of the prohect was to create a GUI using Tkinter that could be used to demonstrate some of the concepts learnt during my second year quantum mechanics course. Overall for this python module, I achieved a grade of 75%.

The theoretical background of the physics of the project is included in Section 1 of the report.

## How to run the project ##

The project can be run by running GUI.py once all the packages are installed.

## Description of the file structure ##

GUI.py is the single executable python script implementing classes (this project was created before I knew how to correctly implement more than one file in a python project).Report.pdf is a report of the project discussing the theoretical background, what the code is able to plot, what the user interface looks like, some problems encountered with the code and finally a conclusion. The other gif files are loaded into the interface through GUI.py.

Some documentation of the project is also included in the report.

## Packages Required: ##
Environment set up in python 2.7 and runs with following packages:
* numpy        V:1.15.1
* tk           V:8.5.13
* matplotlib   V:2.1.0
